        <title>Live Insights using Pentaho and CTools - Part 1: Overview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This series of posts/post has origins on the last Pentaho Community Meeting that took place in London, November last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PentahoCommunityMeetup2015/info&quot;&gt;PCM 2015&lt;/a&gt;. You can follow up on&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pcm15%20pentaho&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first evening, there was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Pentaho-London-User-Group/events/222548597/&quot;&gt;hackathon&lt;/a&gt;, where me Miguel Cunhal and Sam … (sorry Sam, don’t know your last name), received a Raspberry Pi, coutesy of &lt;a href=&quot;[https://twitter.com/ivyinfosystems]&quot;&gt;Ivy IS&lt;/a&gt; as a prize. We really hadn’t the time to complete the project, so I felt that I needed to give them (organization and community) more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that a Rapesberry Pi is largely used on IoT (Internet Of Things) projects, I will share what we I am calling &lt;strong&gt;Live Insight comming from IoT&lt;/strong&gt;, using Pentaho technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quick-introduction&quot;&gt;Quick introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When talking about IoT and Social Innovation (I feel like I should write a new blog post, about my point of view about this terminologies), there are some use cases were we need to display “real-time” data, coming from all kind of “things”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the title of the blog post, I’ve used the name Live Insights and not real-time, that’s because real-time at the hardware level is done in milli/micro seconds. Not that we can’t do it really fast at the software level, but it’s not fair for people working in some areas, like electronics, where the concept of real-time can be different from the one where we are displaying information on the bowser and coming through. That’s the reason why I have used the title “Live Insight”, and just to make it clear, this is an example on how data being generated by sensors can be processed on the fly and be delivered (over the internet using) with low lattency with a lower lattency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one of the ways to do it, let’s start to cover it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Rapesberry Pi that might have some sensors connected, a mobile phone, a twitter account, and many other “things”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When trying to display live data over the internet using a browser we need to keep in mind the internet lattency we might face, as also the time that might be needed to do some calculations, agreggations, clean up, etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;considerations&quot;&gt;Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a huge demand for real-time dashboards, but first, there are some questions that we might need to raise before starting this kind of projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How often is important to have data refreshed in my data analysis dashboard? Usually, after making this question you might realize that you wont need a high refresh rate as you first might tougth about. One, two, five seconds or more might be more than enought. Of couse that this depends and varies with the use case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can the users, really understand what is going on, when using to high refresh rates? Well I don’t believe so, anyhow it depends on the refresh rate, it will depends on the capabilities of each user, but usually the user will get lost just when trying to interpret results faster that he is able to. So I would say this is a very important point where we should be carefull. The user should always be able to easly understand what it’s being displayed. We should not allow micro intervals between each update, and do it more often than necessary. This can be controlled on the back-end.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another question that might raise is, shoud we keep the same speed the device is using to sent new information? I would say no, and we might wnat to do some aggregations because it might not make sense to dsiplay the information for a specific devive, but can mae sense to diplay it to multiple devices by doing some aggregations/calculations. So before the data being displayed we might have the need to massage data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-we-need-to-build-a-solution-like-this&quot;&gt;What do we need to build a solution like this?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider to be 3 important concepts that were considered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to make data arrive from the devices and reach the dashboard, that could also be done the other way arround and build a prescriptive solution;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to use Data Integration process data, that is done as soon as messages arrives from the devices;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to present live data in the dashboard. Currently there are multiple ways to do it and it does not need to be with CDE, anyhow it will bring you some other advantages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what we really need to have in place to be able to have it working:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pentaho BA Server &amp;amp; Pentaho Data Integration (of course);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Message Broker (messaging publish/subscribe system);
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For this proof-of-concept I have used a message broker and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mqtt.org/&quot;&gt;MQTT&lt;/a&gt; as the protocol to exchange messages that goes from the IoT devices to the dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I have used &lt;a href=&quot;http://mosquitto.org/&quot;&gt;Mosquitto&lt;/a&gt;, available as a docker container.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MQTT libraries:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I have used &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipse.org/paho/clients/java/&quot;&gt;Paho&lt;/a&gt; for the back-end ;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js&quot;&gt;MQTT.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;small-video&quot;&gt;Small video&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have build a small sample about one of the ways to achieved this, using Data Integration Streaming to process live data and how to display this live data on a CTools dashboard. Here you can find a small video, to show it working, but keep in mind this is just an overview demo, it does not get into details (latter posts will detail).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0MKaTKrkAw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-work&quot;&gt;Future work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will write some more posts on this subject, giving some more details about the architecture, the back-end and front-end. Just write a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/migfgaspar&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; so that I can know how mutch detail will you want/need to get. Another post should be written to highlight some of the architecture for scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also want to write some blog post/posts about how would be the full high leevl architecture for a real system that would allows to scale easly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a solution based on messagic-centric concepts but I also wnat to build a data-centric proof-of-concept, of course the architecture and technology will change a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start to think the way it would be possible to have it work out-of-the-box in CDA/CDE and even in Pentaho Analyzer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-challenges&quot;&gt;Future challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I wold like to start preparing a new series of blog posts about &lt;strong&gt;embedding CTools visualizations in Augmented Reality applications&lt;/strong&gt;? Who wants to send me some google glass to build the prooof-of-concept? Who dares to be involved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any questions please send email or contact me over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/miguel.ferreira.gaspar&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mfgaspar&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning Pentaho CTools</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pentaho and CTools are two of the fastest and most rapidly growing tools for practical solutions not found in any other tool available on the market. Using Pentaho allows you to build a complete analytics solution, and CTools brings an advanced flexibility to customizing them in a remarkable way. CTools provides its users with the ability to utilize Web technologies and data visualization concepts, and make the most of best practices to create a huge visual impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover was already released: 
&lt;img src=&quot;http://mfgaspar.github.io/assets/B04770_BookCover_small.png&quot; alt=&quot;Learning Pentaho CTools Cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;book-overview&quot;&gt;Book Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book starts with the basics of the framework and how to get data to your dashboards. We’ll take you all the way through to create your custom and advanced dashboards that will create an effective visual impact and provide the best user experience. You will be given deep insights into the lifecycle of dashboards and the working of various components. Further, you will create a custom dashboard using the Community Dashboards Editor and use data sources to load data on the components. You will also create custom content using Query, the Freeform Addins Popup, and text components. Next, you will make use of widgets to create similar sections and duplicate components to reproduce other components on a dashboard. You will then learn to build a plugin without writing Java code, use Pentaho App Builder as a CPK plugin manager, and understand the application of deployment and version control to dashboard development. Finally, you will learn tips and tricks that can be very useful while embedding dashboards into other applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide is an invaluable tutorial if you are planning to use custom and advanced dashboards among the solutions that you are building with Pentaho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-you-will-learn&quot;&gt;What You Will Learn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Community Tools on Pentaho; and understand the necessary concepts and considerations when creating an exciting dashboard design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get data from many different Pentaho data sources and deliver it in different formats (CSV, XLS, XML, or JSON)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the Community Data Access (CDA) as the data abstraction layer and understand the concepts in the Community Dashboard Framework (CDF)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a Community Dashboard Editor (CDE) dashboard and make the most of the main components&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create and make use of widgets and use duplicate components to have data-driven sections on the dashboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customize and create interaction between all components, including charts, using the Community Charts Components&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create and embed dashboards in a better and new way&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a Pentaho plugin using the Pentaho App Builder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create plugins and make use of parameters inside Pentaho without writing code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-this-book-is-for&quot;&gt;Who This Book Is For&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a CTools developer and would like to expand your knowledge and create attractive dashboards and frameworks, this book is the go-to-guide for you. A basic knowledge of JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is highly recommended. Definitely a knowledge on Pentaho is a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-pentaho-CTools&quot;&gt;Packt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Pentaho-CTools-Miguel-Gaspar-ebook/dp/B0171UHJJ6/&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was expected to be out at the end of this month, but since tomorrow is the last day of the month, It will get a bit delayed :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New date points to the &lt;strong&gt;22th of April&lt;/strong&gt;, let’s hope we can keep this date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any questions please send email or contact me over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/miguel.ferreira.gaspar&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/migfgaspar&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mfgaspar&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Cooking Analytics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hope you can find this Blog interesting, where you will be able to read about Analytics solutions bringing architecture discussions, development technics that can be aplied to Big Data solutions, IoT or Social Innovation solutions, most of the time focused in Pentaho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the times you will find just pointers to some other blogs and posts with very intersting stuff, that I believe it might bring value to the topics being discussed. It’s important for me to get feedback from you so that I can go in your way, at the end the blog is for you, so I will relly on you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me also apologise for the poor English that you might find in the posts, I am getting better day-by-day but still with lots to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to complement the text with images and videos as mutch as I can. Not sure I will be able to add a section for comments, but will investigate how it can it be done using this or another theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I would prefer to use twitter, facebook for comments, discussions, … and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send me an email if it’s a private comment or question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking foward to get feedback from you!&lt;/p&gt;
